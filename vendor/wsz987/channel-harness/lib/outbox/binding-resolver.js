/**
 * Durable Binding Authority.
 *
 * Outbox authorization comes from the DURABLE `SessionBindingStore`, NEVER from
 * the in-memory `AgentManager` cache. `AgentManager.bindingFor()` is only a
 * hint used by the reply pipeline; a send MUST re-resolve through
 * `findBySessionId` so it sees the current durable binding — including after a
 * `/new`, at which point the retired session's durable binding is gone and the
 * send must fail closed (from the binding update onward, session A's
 * outbox has lost authority).
 *
 * `findBySessionId` fails closed with `AmbiguousBindingError`
 * (OUTBOX_AMBIGUOUS_BINDING) when one session id maps to more than one current
 * binding; here it is surfaced as the typed `OutboxError` with the same code.
