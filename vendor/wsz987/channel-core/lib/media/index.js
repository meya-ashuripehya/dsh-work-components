 * Secure host boundary for remote binary media plus the

 * `@wsz987/channel-core/media` exports the pure bounded stream reader, the

 * together over an injectable fetch, the pure MIME hint helpers, and the
 * protocol-agnostic `applyHydrationResult` / `isHydratableBinaryPart`.
 * None of these modules perform network I/O by themselves; the fetcher is
 * the single seam that does.
