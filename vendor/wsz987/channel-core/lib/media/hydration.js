/**
 * Protocol-agnostic application of a platform resolver result onto one binary
 * `MessagePart` (mutates `part` in place, returns nothing).
 *
 * Behavior contract:
 * 1. `part.localData` already present → `resolve()` is NOT called and the part
 *    is returned untouched (no double download) — even when the policy would
 *    fail, an already-hydrated part wins.
 * 2. `policy.signal` aborted before `resolve()` starts → never start the
 *    download; `part.ingressFailure = 'download-failed'`. (Choice: a
 *    pre-aborted signal reads as a cancelled download, matching the bounded
 *    reader's ABORTED → 'download-failed' mapping in
 *    `toIngressFailureCode`.)
 * 3. `resolve()` throws → `part.ingressFailure` is set via
 *    `toIngressFailureCode(error)` (BodyTooLargeError → 'too-large',
 *    UnsafeHostError / remote policy codes → 'resource-unavailable', anything
 *    else → 'download-failed'). This function never throws for hydration
 *    failures.
 * 4. `policy.signal` aborted while `resolve()` was in flight → the delivered
 *    bytes are discarded and `part.ingressFailure = 'download-failed'`
 *    (cancellation wins over a result that arrived after the abort).
 * 5. `result.data.byteLength > policy.maxBytes` → `part.ingressFailure =
 *    'too-large'`. The locator fields (`url` / `resourceRef`) and any
 *    previously-known `size` are retained; the oversized bytes are never
 *    stored and `size` is never derived from them.
 * 6. Success → `part.localData = result.data`, `part.size =
 *    result.data.byteLength` (actual bytes are authoritative over any
 *    previously-known size), `result.mimeType` / `result.name` are merged in
 *    when provided (existing hints are kept otherwise), and
 *    `part.ingressFailure` is cleared — a hydrated part is a healthy part.
 *
 * Failure paths write ONLY `part.ingressFailure`; the `url` / `resourceRef` /
 * `dataUri` fields are never touched, and no other field is mutated on error.
